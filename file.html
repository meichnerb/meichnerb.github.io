<div class="sub-header">
          Total Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Country from 1990 to 2016
</div>
<div class="info" id="header">
    For my project I found a data set for the total greenhouse gas emissions for the past
    16 years by country on the World Bank databank.  You can download a csv of this information
    <a href="http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&series=EN.ATM.GHGT.KT.CE&country=">here</a>.
    The data set includes:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Series Name</li>
      <li>Series Code</li>
      <li>Country Name</li>
      <li>Country Code</li>
      <li>Total greenhouse gas emissions by year (1990-2016)</li>
      </ul>
    <br>
    Here are a couple different ways I would visualize this data:
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>A world map where the countries change color based on how much greenhouse gases are emitted,
        incorporating a year slider.</li>
        <br>
      <li>A set of circles whose radius is directly related to the numerical value of the emissions,
        where you can click on the circle to get the country info, also incorporating a year slider.</li>
        <br>
      <li>A stacked line graph with year as the x axis and emissions as the y, showing the countries
        of one particular continent at a time, or by economic group, which is selected with buttons.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
